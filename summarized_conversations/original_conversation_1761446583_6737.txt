JSON/YAML editor\n\n## Starting Feature 3 Implementation\n\n<function_calls>\n<create-file file_path="itechsmart-ninja/FEATURE3_PROGRESS.md">\n# Feature 3: Embedded Code Editors - Progress Report\n\n## Current Status: 🚧 0% COMPLETE\n\n**Started:** Current Session\n**Target Completion:** This session\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Feature Overview\n\nFeature 3 adds embedded code editors to iTechSmart Ninja, providing rich editing experiences directly within VS Code:\n\n1. **Monaco Editor** - Full VS Code editor with syntax highlighting\n2. **Image Editor** - Fabric.js-based image manipulation\n3. **Website Builder** - GrapesJS visual website builder\n4. **Markdown Editor** - Live preview markdown editor\n5. **JSON/YAML Editor** - Structured data editors with validation\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Monaco Editor Integration (30%)\n- [ ] Create Monaco webview provider\n- [ ] Add syntax highlighting for 20+ languages\n- [ ] Implement IntelliSense/autocomplete\n- [ ] Add file operations (open, save, close)\n- [ ] Multi-tab support\n- [ ] Theme support (light/dark)\n\n### 2. Image Editor (20%)\n- [ ] Integrate Fabric.js\n- [ ] Basic drawing tools (pen, shapes, text)\n- [ ] Image filters and effects\n- [ ] Layer management\n- [ ] Export functionality (PNG, JPG, SVG)\n\n### 3. Website Builder (25%)\n- [ ] Integrate GrapesJS\n- [ ] Component library\n- [ ] Drag-and-drop interface\n- [ ] Responsive design preview\n- [ ] Export HTML/CSS/JS\n- [ ] Template system\n\n### 4. Markdown Editor (15%)\n- [ ] Live preview\n- [ ] Syntax highlighting\n- [ ] Table of contents generation\n- [ ] Export to HTML/PDF\n\n### 5. JSON/YAML Editor (10%)\n- [ ] Schema validation\n- [ ] Auto-formatting\n- [ ] Error highlighting\n- [ ] Tree view\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Progress Tracking\n\n**Total Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours\n**Current Progress:** 0%\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n\n1. Create Monaco Editor webview provider\n2. Implement basic editor functionality\n3. Add language support\n4. Create image editor\n5. Integrate website builder\n\n---\n\n**Status:** 🚧 STARTING\n**Priority:** HIGH\n**Timeline:** On track\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}

Check token has correct scopes\n2. Verify token hasn\'t expired\n3. Try regenerating token\n4. Check token is set correctly:\n   ```bash\n   GET /api/v1/github/user\n   ```\n\n### Rate Limit Exceeded\n1. Wait for rate limit reset\n2. Check rate limit status:\n   ```bash\n   # Response headers include:\n   X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000\n   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4999\n   X-RateLimit-Reset: 1234567890\n   ```\n3. Use authenticated requests (higher limits)\n\n### Repository Not Found\n1. Check repository name is correct\n2. Verify you have access to the repository\n3. Check repository visibility (public/private)\n4. Ensure token has `repo` scope for private repos\n\n### Permission Denied\n1. Check token has required scopes\n2. Verify you\'re a collaborator on the repository\n3. Check repository settings\n4. Try with a new token with full permissions\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Additional Resources\n\n- **Full Documentation:** See `FEATURE4_COMPLETE.md`\n- **API Reference:** See `backend/app/api/github.py`\n- **GitHub API Docs:** https://docs.github.com/en/rest\n- **Token Scopes:** https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps\n\n---\n\n## 🎉 Quick Examples\n\n### Example 1: List My Repositories\n```bash\n> gh-repos\n# Select repository type: All\n# View list of repositories\n# Select a repository to see details\n```\n\n### Example 2: Create and Merge PR\n```bash\n# Create PR\n> gh-create-pr\nRepository: owner/repo\nTitle: Add new feature\nHead: feature-branch\nBase: main\nDescription: This adds...\n\n# Review PR\nCtrl+Shift+P → iTechSmart: Review Pull Request\nRepository: owner/repo\nPR Number: 123\nReview Type: Approve\nComment: LGTM!\n\n# Merge PR (via API)\nPUT /api/v1/github/repos/owner/repo/pulls/123/merge\n```\n\n### Example 3: Create Issue and Track\n```bash\n# Create issue\n> gh-create-issue\nRepository: owner/repo\nTitle: Bug: Login fails\nDescription: When I try to login...\n\n# Add comment\nPOST /api/v1/github/repos/owner/repo/issues/456/comments\n{\n  "body": "I\'m working on this"\n}\n\n# Close issue\nPATCH /api/v1/github/repos/owner/repo/issues/456\n{\n  "state": "closed"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Happy Coding! 🚀**\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}
