## 🎯 CORRECTIVE ACTION NEEDED

I need to:
1. Build the 7 missing products with YOUR exact names and features
2. Possibly rename/refactor the incorrectly named products
3. Complete iTechSmart Marketplace with all features

**Total Products Needed**: 9 (existing) + 10 (new) = 19 products  
**Currently Correct**: 9 (existing) + 2-3 (new) = 11-12 products  
**Still Need**: 7-8 products

## ❓ NEXT STEPS

Would you like me to:
1. **Build the 7 missing products** with correct names and features?
2. **Keep the incorrectly named products** and just add the missing ones (total 26 products)?
3. **Rename/refactor** the incorrect products to match your list?

Please advise how you'd like me to proceed!
